The frontend product editor for WooCommerce helps you quickly edit products from the frontend.

== Description == 

Frontend Product Editor allows you to edit WooCommerce product data from the frontend quickly.
When you are logged in as admin and visit any WooCommerce product page, it adds a new option in the admin toolbar - Quick Product Edit.
Click on it, and it will open a flyout panel to edit product information quickly. You can also open the editor panel from the floating icon on the right edge of browser. You can edit WooCommerce products from either the Single product page or from product Archive pages (Shop page or Category archives)
